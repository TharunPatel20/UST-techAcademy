# Design Patterns & SOLID Principles

## Design Patterns
- **Creational Patterns**  
  - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.  
  - **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter the type of created objects.  
  - **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step.

- **Structural Patterns**  
  - **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.  
  - **Decorator**: Adds functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure.  
  - **Composite**: Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

- **Behavioral Patterns**  
  - **Observer**: Notifies dependents of changes in state.  
  - **Strategy**: Enables selecting algorithms at runtime.  
  - **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, enabling undoable operations.

## SOLID Principles
- **S**: **Single Responsibility Principle**  
  A class should have only one reason to change.

- **O**: **Open/Closed Principle**  
  Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- **L**: **Liskov Substitution Principle**  
  Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering functionality.

- **I**: **Interface Segregation Principle**  
  Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

- **D**: **Dependency Inversion Principle**  
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
