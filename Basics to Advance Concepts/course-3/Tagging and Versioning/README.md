# Skill Description:

- `Develop foundational expertise in Git, covering version control basics, branching, collaboration with remote repositories, tagging for versioning, and handling ignored files and temporary changes. Additionally, explore Git hooks, GUI tools, and the Git Flow workflow for advanced version control strategies. Gain hands-on experience to efficiently manage code changes and collaboration workflows using Git.`

## Tagging and Versioning

> Create tags to mark specific versions or releases of the project.
> Explore the difference between lightweight tags and annotated tags.
> Rollback to a previous tagged version to simulate version control in action.

## Learning Outcomes:

> Learn how to create tags for versioning.
> Understand the difference between lightweight and annotated tags.
> Simulate version control by rolling back to a tagged version.
